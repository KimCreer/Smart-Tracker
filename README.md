# Smart Attendance Tracker

Effortless attendance management for your Google Meet sessions.

## Overview
Smart Attendance Tracker is a Chrome extension designed to automate and simplify attendance tracking for Google Meet sessions. It provides real-time monitoring, detailed analytics, and secure data storage, making it ideal for teachers, business managers, and event organizers.

## Features
- **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Automatically captures attendance data from Google Meet sessions without manual input.
- **Detailed Reports:** Generate comprehensive attendance reports for individual sessions or participants.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Monitor attendance as the session progresses, ensuring no one is missed.
- **Secure Data Storage:** All attendance records are stored securely using Chrome's async storage.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Visualize participation trends, hand raises, mic and camera usage, and more.
- **Export Options:** Export attendance reports in PDF or Excel format (Google account required).

## How It Works
1. **Login:** Sign in using your Google account via Google OAuth (Google Console) for secure and personalized access. The system integrates seamlessly with your Google Meet sessions.
2. **Set Up Your Session:** Provide details like the Google Meet link, session title, date, and time. Customize tracking settings as needed.
3. **Start Tracking:** When the session begins, the system automatically tracks attendance in real-time by scraping the Google Meet web page and analyzing the DOM.
4. **View Reports:** After the session, generate detailed attendance reports, including join/leave times and attendance duration.
5. **Manage Attendance:** Review and edit logs, and export reports for record-keeping or sharing (Google account required).

## System Limitations
- **Google Meet Only:** Currently supports only Google Meet sessions. Other platforms like Zoom or Microsoft Teams are not compatible.
- **Login Requirement:** Only users with Google accounts can export or save attendance data. Guests can view tracking data but cannot export or save it.
- **Web Scraping Limitations:** Attendance tracking relies on web scraping and DOM manipulation. Changes to the Google Meet interface may affect functionality until the extension is updated.
- **Network Dependency:** Real-time tracking depends on the quality of the Google Meet connection and browser performance.
